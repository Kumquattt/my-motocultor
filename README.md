# MyMotocultor ðŸ¤˜

This is a simple web page to track your running-order at the Motocultor 2025, as I could not find any official one. <br/>
Simply select the bands you want to see, press the star button, and only your those are visible ! You can also filter by day.

# Build and deployment

Run and build the project like any angular (20) project.

# Licensing

I am not well versed in those, but basically:

- This code is open-source and free to use
- If you reuse part or all of the project, you must credit me
- This code can not be reused in for-profit softwares of any kind
